## Installing

Download MVAL (https://github.com/YazhouTUD/MVAL) and add it to the search path of Matlab.

## Usage

Just run "Main.m" to see how it works.

Choose "choice" from {1,2,3} depending on the used active learning algorithms:

choice:  choose the active learning algorithms

    1 -- Random sampling.
    
    2 -- ALRL_MaxE: our method with MaxE.
    
    3 -- ALRL_MVAL: our method with MVAL.
